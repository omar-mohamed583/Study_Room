 * identical to the first client render (no hydration mismatch), and costs the
 * minority at most the frame between hydration and the store's first real read.
 * The pure-CSS half of the problem is already correct at first paint for them
 * anyway: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — Tailwind's

/**
 * Whether the user has asked the system to reduce motion — as a boolean that
 * stays true to the OS setting for the component's whole life.
 *
 * Built on `useSyncExternalStore` rather than `useEffect` + `useState`, because
 * `matchMedia` is the textbook external mutable source: it changes outside
 * React's render cycle (the user flips the setting in System Settings, or an
 * automation does at sunset) and it has to be read tear-free under concurrent
 * rendering. React gets the three primitives — subscribe, client snapshot,
 * server snapshot — and decides itself when to re-render. There is no effect
 * body calling `setState`, and therefore no double render on mount and no
 * window where the rendered value disagrees with the live media query.
 *
 * What the value means for a consumer, in order of how often it is got wrong:
 *
 * 1. **`true` is not "no feedback"** — it is "no *movement*". Replace the
 *    journey, keep the destination: a count-up commits its final number, a
 *    slide-in appears in place, a spinner becomes a static "Loading…". Deleting
 *    the feedback entirely leaves the reduced-motion user with a UI that seems
 *    not to respond.
 * 2. **It can flip mid-session.** The OS setting is live and this hook re-renders
 *    on it, so anything the value gates must be able to stop: put `reduced` in
 *    the dependency array of the effect that owns the rAF loop / interval /
 *    observer, and cancel in that effect's cleanup. An animation started while
 *    the value was `false` must die when it becomes `true`.
 * 3. **CSS first.** If a transition or keyframe animation can express it, write
 *    `motion-reduce:transition-none` / `motion-reduce:animate-none` instead:
 *    that branch is already correct on the first server-rendered paint, with no
 *    hydration and no JavaScript. This hook is for the decisions CSS cannot
 *    reach — whether to *start* a loop, a timer, an autoplay, a physics
 *    simulation.
 *
 * Every caller shares a single `MediaQueryList`; the per-component cost is one
 * `change` listener, removed on unmount by the subscription's own cleanup.
